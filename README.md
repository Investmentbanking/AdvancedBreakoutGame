# BreakoutGame created using **Java Swing**
# Objective
The objective of the game is to use the paddle to bounce the ball towards the bricks to destroy them. Once all the bricks have been destroyed you win the game and it takes you back to the main menu. If the ball falls below the paddle you lose a life. The player has 3 lives and loses the game when they lose all their lives.
